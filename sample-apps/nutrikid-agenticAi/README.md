**NutriKids: Agentic AI for Pediatric Nutrition** is an [MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://nitrostack.ai) server that extends AI assistants — like Claude, Cursor, and any MCP-compatible client — with new, real-world capabilities. It is built and deployed on [Nitrostack](https://nitrostack.ai), the fastest way to build, deploy, and share MCP apps.

## Overview

A pediatric nutrition intelligence system that uses NitroStack's Model Context Protocol (MCP) to orchestrate Growth, Medical, and Food agents, delivering personalised, evidence-based nutrition guidance through a Supervisor Agent.

## What is MCP?

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard that lets AI assistants securely connect to external tools, data sources, and services. Instead of being limited to what it was trained on, an AI model can call **MCP servers** to fetch live data, run actions, and integrate with real systems.

This project is one such MCP server. Learn more about building and shipping MCP apps at [nitrostack.ai](https://nitrostack.ai).

## Features

- 🔌 **MCP-native** — works with any MCP-compatible client (Claude, Cursor, and more)
- 🛠️ **Tools, resources & prompts** — exposes structured capabilities to AI agents
- ⚡ **Deployed on Nitrostack** — reliable, hosted, and instantly shareable
- 🔐 **Secure by design** — secrets stay in environment variables, never in code
- 🧩 **Composable** — combine with other MCP apps to build powerful AI workflows

## Live Demo

🚀 **Live MCP endpoint:** https://nutrikid-6a65078a-hooli-amrita-university-coimbatore.app.nitrocloud.ai

Point your MCP client at the endpoint above to try it instantly. Prefer a hosted setup? Deploy your own in minutes on [Nitrostack](https://nitrostack.ai).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ (or your project runtime)
- An MCP-compatible client (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-mcp-project.git
cd nutrikids-agentic-ai-for-pediatric-nutrition
npm install
```

### Configuration

Copy the example environment file and add your own values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### Run

```bash
npm run start
```

## Connect to an MCP Client

Add this server to your MCP client configuration. A typical entry looks like:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nutrikids-agentic-ai-for-pediatric-nutrition": {
      "url": "https://nutrikid-6a65078a-hooli-amrita-university-coimbatore.app.nitrocloud.ai"
    }
  }
}
```

Restart your client and the tools from this MCP server will be available to your AI assistant.
