## Overview

Rightly is an intelligent Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that acts as a personal consumer protection advocate. Pre-purchase, it performs deep analysis on product listings by extracting true specifications, filtering out fake reviews, assessing repairability scores, and identifying deceptive marketing. Post-purchase, it generates step-by-step resolution plans for defective goods. When disputes arise, Rightly can instantly locate hard-to-find official support channels, find local repair centers, and automatically draft and email formal legal demand notices to vendors.

Who it is for: It is built for everyday consumers who want to make highly informed purchasing decisions and avoid buyer's remorse, as well as those feeling overwhelmed by confusing return policies or unresponsive customer support when dealing with defective products.

What makes it special: Rightly bridges the gap between AI chat and interactive UI. Instead of just returning walls of text, it uses the NitroStack Framework to render beautiful, interactive React widgets directly inside the AI client. Users can review rich product analysis cards, click through interactive resolution checklists, review drafted legal documents on a formal UI, and click a single "Send via Email" button to dispatch their legal notice directly to the seller—all without ever leaving the chat interface. It also features intelligent offline fallbacks to ensure consumers always have access to support links, even if APIs fail.

## What is MCP?

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard that lets AI assistants securely connect to external tools, data sources, and services. Instead of being limited to what it was trained on, an AI model can call **MCP servers** to fetch live data, run actions, and integrate with real systems.

This project is one such MCP server. Learn more about building and shipping MCP apps at [nitrostack.ai](https://nitrostack.ai).

## Features

- 🔌 **MCP-native** — works with any MCP-compatible client (Claude, Cursor, and more)
- 🛠️ **Tools, resources & prompts** — exposes structured capabilities to AI agents
- ⚡ **Deployed on Nitrostack** — reliable, hosted, and instantly shareable
- 🔐 **Secure by design** — secrets stay in environment variables, never in code
- 🧩 **Composable** — combine with other MCP apps to build powerful AI workflows

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ (or your project runtime)
- An MCP-compatible client (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-mcp-project.git
cd rightly-an-mcp-assistant-for-intelligent-product-analysis-an
npm install
```

### Configuration

Copy the example environment file and add your own values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### Run

```bash
npm run start
```

## Connect to an MCP Client

Add this server to your MCP client configuration. A typical entry looks like:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "rightly-an-mcp-assistant-for-intelligent-product-analysis-an": {
      "command": "npm",
      "args": ["run", "start"]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart your client and the tools from this MCP server will be available to your AI assistant.
