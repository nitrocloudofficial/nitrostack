**WARDEN — an MCP server that assumes every website it reads is trying to trick it** is an [MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://nitrostack.ai) server that extends AI assistants — like Claude, Cursor, and any MCP-compatible client — with new, real-world capabilities. It is built and deployed on [Nitrostack](https://nitrostack.ai), the fastest way to build, deploy, and share MCP apps.

## Overview

WARDEN is an MCP server for security teams drowning in vulnerabilities — thousands open, time to fix five.

It does three things nobody combines. It ranks by evidence, not theory: instead of a severity score that says what could go wrong, it checks whether a bug is actually being exploited (CISA KEV) and how likely it is to be hit (FIRST EPSS) — so a "terrifying" 9.8 nobody attacks is deprioritised, and a modest 7.5 used by ransomware crews gets patched today.

It defends itself. Threat-intel work means feeding AI attacker-written text — the perfect vehicle for prompt injection. WARDEN never hands raw fetched pages to the model: it extracts facts server-side, quarantines hidden commands, and flags the attempt without being affected by it.

And it knows its limits. It auto-fixes what it safely can (a ready-to-review patch PR), flags what needs a human, and refers the rest — but it never touches production, by design.

Every decision, including rejected leads, is fully auditable. Open Innovation / cybersecurity.

## What is MCP?

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard that lets AI assistants securely connect to external tools, data sources, and services. Instead of being limited to what it was trained on, an AI model can call **MCP servers** to fetch live data, run actions, and integrate with real systems.

This project is one such MCP server. Learn more about building and shipping MCP apps at [nitrostack.ai](https://nitrostack.ai).

## Features

- 🔌 **MCP-native** — works with any MCP-compatible client (Claude, Cursor, and more)
- 🛠️ **Tools, resources & prompts** — exposes structured capabilities to AI agents
- ⚡ **Deployed on Nitrostack** — reliable, hosted, and instantly shareable
- 🔐 **Secure by design** — secrets stay in environment variables, never in code
- 🧩 **Composable** — combine with other MCP apps to build powerful AI workflows

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ (or your project runtime)
- An MCP-compatible client (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-mcp-project.git
cd warden-an-mcp-server-that-assumes-every-website-it-reads-is-
npm install
```

### Configuration

Copy the example environment file and add your own values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### Run

```bash
npm run start
```

## Connect to an MCP Client

Add this server to your MCP client configuration. A typical entry looks like:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "warden-an-mcp-server-that-assumes-every-website-it-reads-is-": {
      "command": "npm",
      "args": ["run", "start"]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart your client and the tools from this MCP server will be available to your AI assistant.

## FAQ

### What is an MCP server?

An MCP server implements the Model Context Protocol to expose tools, resources, and prompts that AI assistants can call. It lets an AI model take real actions and access live data.

### What does WARDEN — an MCP server that assumes every website it reads is trying to trick it do?

WARDEN is an MCP server for security teams drowning in vulnerabilities — thousands open, time to fix five.

### Which AI clients does this work with?

Any MCP-compatible client, including Claude Desktop and Cursor. New clients are adding MCP support regularly.

### How do I deploy my own MCP app?

Use [Nitrostack](https://nitrostack.ai) to build, deploy, and host MCP apps without managing infrastructure.
